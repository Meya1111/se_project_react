# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project - In this project I implemented three key React features. First, I built a temperature unit toggle (°F/°C) using React Context so the selected unit is available across the app without any errors, and components re render when the context value changes. Then I added a Profile page using React Router with a dedicated /profile route and navigation, enabling transitions without full page reloads. Lastly, I implemented form submission with controlled components to manage input state, validate entries, and submit clean data to the app’s handlers. Together, these features improve state sharing, navigation, and reliable user input in a maintainable React structure.

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an api, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.
